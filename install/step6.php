Congrats, we're almoust done!<br />
Now you can delete the install/ folder from your webserver as it is not needed anymore. I hardly recommend this, because there is no security or anything applied to this files. Anyone could just use them and do all these settings.<br />
But please note that this is now 'admin' page, nor is anything like this included. You have to perform any changes you want to make from via ftp or mysql or write your own admin system!<br />
I suggest modding the templates and the CSS best for your likes and style.<br />
Tanks again for using my software, and if you find any bugs or can contribute features or ideas please contact me.<br />
Now you're ready to go!</p>
